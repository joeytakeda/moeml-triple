# Ontologies Workshop

## The Challenge

* Collections (arts, cultural & natural history)
* Archives and literature: treaties, letters, poems
* Administration/preservation/conservation records
* Science and scholarship: investigation, interpretation
* Presentations: Exhibits, teaching, and publication

## The Requirements

* Understand history from relationships
   * between people, events and things
   * How to express these relationships?
* How to make a documentation standard?
   * Each aspect needs its own approach
   * Data overlap: common elements
   * Single schema: massive
* What is best for your purposes? RDF and TripleStores and relational databases

## Eight Basic Requirements for Data Integration

* Events
* Person
* Place
* Time/Date
* Physical Objects
* Conceptual Objects (the abstract concept of something)
   * Intellectual Property Rights (and likely then responsibility for the thing)
* Names
* Types
